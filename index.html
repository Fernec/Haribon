    <h1>History.</h1>
    <br>
    <b>The Haribon.</b>
    <p> It was first discovered in the year 1896 by british nautralist John Whitehead in Paranas, Samar. Due to the monkey remains found in the specimens nest the eagle was named The Monkey-Eating Eagle.</p>

    <br>

    <p> Fun fact: The sceintific name of the Philipine Eagle(Pithecophaga jefferyi) was in honour of Jhon Whitehead's father,    Jeffery.</p>

    <br>

    <p> Finally almost a century later after its discovery in 1896, on 1995 July 4, under proclamtion no. 615, s. 1995 the haribon became what we know now officially as "The Philipine Eagle."  </p>
